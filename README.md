## PokéGen
PokéGen was created for the love of Pokémon, Pokémon cards, and the love of creating something hilarious. Take your favorite image or picture using a direct link URL, and add all the features you want, like type, attack, weakness, and resistance, just like an actual Pokémon card! Humor is encouraged through the whole process, but everyone has their own style. Will your PokéGen card be the best there ever was?!


## Planning & Wireframes
### When planning PokéGen the following user stories were considered:
* User should be able to see all cards created whether logged in or not.
* User should be able to log in and register if they dont have an account.
* User should be able to create a card after they logged in/registered.
* User should be able to see all the cards they have created.
* User should be able to favorite cards and have them displayed in a special way.
* User should be able to see other users collection of cards.
* User should be able to edit their card and change all values only if it is their card.
* User should be able to click a card and it brings them to the card's showpage.
* User should be able to log out. 

### Wireframes

The planning of what content was displayed on each page and where it was displayed on the page was a work in progress through this whole project. We wanted the user to always be influenced to make an card or just see other cards that were created. We also wanted to make sure all cards get to be seen at least once, so we created a different card to be displayed on the homepage and the user list page each item the page is refreshed.

In order to create a PokéGen card you have to log in or register, but only a username and password is needed. Once you register you will asked to create your first card! 

Each card is a bunch of <div>'s stacked on top of each other in other to get the full design. Each input has a maximum value for the position of the images and text to be rendered on the card, but we gave enough space for good humor.



## Future development
* User should be able to upload their own images, and not always have to use the direct link URL
* Implement a like system and those with the highest likes will have a special display.
* Have more user to user interaction, possibly like a trading system?



## Unsolved problems
* On the userlist, when hovering over the last user the names become stacked on top of each other.
* As said before, page layout is a constant work in progress, but more of the positioning of all the content on each page.
