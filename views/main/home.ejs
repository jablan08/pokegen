                        Create your PokéGen's name, give it health points(HP), choose it's element, add some stats like age or height, and add something to the  bottom of the card. <br>
                        You can give your PokéGen two attacks with a damage value and a details of the attack, and also a weakness and resistance. <br>
                        Finally add a picture to your PokéGen using a direct link URL ending with .jpg or .png and don't forget a story of why this card was generated! After you create your card, go to the edit page to favorite it so it gets displayed in your favorite Hall of Fame! And of course, humor is encouraged through the whole process.</p>
